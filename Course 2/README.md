Python Data Structures

session: Feb 29 — Apr 25

About the Course:

This course will introduce the core data structures of the Python programming language. We will move past the basics of procedural programming and explore how we can use the Python built-in data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples to perform increasingly complex data analysis. This course will cover Chapters 6-10 of the textbook “Python for Informatics”.  This course is equivalent to the second half of the 11-week "Programming for Everybody (Python)" course.
